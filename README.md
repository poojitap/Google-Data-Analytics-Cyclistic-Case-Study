# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
## Course: Google Data Analytics Capstone

### 1. Introduction
This case study analyzes historical trip data from 'Cyclistic', a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to identify how annual members and casual riders use the service differently to help design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

### 2. Data Cleaning (SQL)
I used SQL Server to process 5.5 million rows of data. 
- Removed records with missing GPS coordinates.
- Filtered out trips with negative durations.
- Created new columns for 'ride_length', 'day_of_week', and 'month'.

### 3. Key Findings
- **Casual riders** take trips that are 70% longer on average than members.
- **Weekend usage** is dominated by casual riders, while members peak during the work week.
- **Seasonality** is a major factor, with casual ridership dropping significantly in winter.

### 5. Recommendations
1. Launch seasonal campaigns in May.
2. Target waterfront stations with physical ads.
3. Focus marketing copy on the "Weekend Value" of membership.
